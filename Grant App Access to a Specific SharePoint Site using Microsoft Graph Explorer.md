## Step 4 ‚Äî Assign Permission to the App
1. In Graph Explorer:
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **URL**:
     ```

     ```
2. **Headers**:
   ```
   Content-Type: application/json
   ```
3. **Body**:
   ```json
   {
     "roles": ["read"],
     "grantedToIdentities": [
       {
         "application": {
           "id": "<AppId>",
           "displayName": "<AppName>"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Replace:
   - `<AppId>` with your app‚Äôs Application (client) ID.
   - `<AppName>` with your app‚Äôs name.
4. Click **Run Query**.

## Step 5 ‚Äî Verify the Permission
1. In Graph Explorer:
   - **Method**: `GET`
   - **URL**:
     ```
     https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{siteId}/permissions
     ```
2. Click **Run Query**.
3. Confirm your app appears with the correct role.

## Step 6 ‚Äî Use the App
- Your app can now call Microsoft Graph for this site using its **own token** (client credentials flow).
- Example:
  ```
  GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{siteId}/lists
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ Available Roles
- `read` ‚Üí Read-only
- `write` ‚Üí Read and write
- `manage` ‚Üí Manage lists/libraries
- `fullcontrol` ‚Üí Full control

---

### üîç Notes & Troubleshooting
- **Sites.Selected** by itself grants no access‚Äîassignment is required per site.
- To remove access, delete the permission object:
  ```
  DELETE /sites/{siteId}/permissions/{permissionId}
  ```

- For automation, use app-only tokens with client credentials (Postman, Insomnia, or scripts).
